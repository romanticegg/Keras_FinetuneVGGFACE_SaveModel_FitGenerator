# Keras_FinetuneVGGFACE_SaveModel_FitGenerator

Example on how to use the keras pre-trained model and custom it on new task.

Example on how to dynamically select the most vacant/available GPU for training the network.

Example on how to define "train_generator" and "validation_generator" for "model.fit_generator" to save more CPU memory instead of loading all the training data in.

Example on how to save the model structure to json file.

Example on how to use "keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint" to save the best model weights of each epoch.

Example on how to use "preprocess_input" to pre-process the input image data.
